The **Training.rar** and **Testing.rar** contains two subfolders in each of them.
- Original_Image: this folder contains the original image acquired from the discharge end of the disc pelletizer.
  
- PixelLabelData: this folder contains the pixel labelled image of the original acquired images.

**Note:**
__PixelLabelData__ folder contains images of manually labeled images of iron ore pellets falling at discharge end of the disc pelletizer,
where __Pellets__ are labeled as __"1"__ and the __Background__ is labeled as __"0"__. 

__*The reader may map the pixels of the labeled images in (0-255) range, to make it clearly visible.*__


As per the comment from esteemed reviewer, two new sub folders are created.
__Training_corrected.zip__ and __Testing_corrected.zip__ contains the labeled images where __"Pellets"__ are labeled as __"255"__ and the __"Background"__ is labeled as __"0"__
